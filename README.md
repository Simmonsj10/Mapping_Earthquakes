# Mapping_Earthquakes
Author: Jerome Simmons

## Background
The purpose of this project is to show the difference between earthquakes over the last seven days. We use Javascript and D3.js libraries to analyze GeoJSON earthquake data (magnitude & coordinates) from the USGS website. We've applied the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.

## Output
Using the aforementioned tools, I've produced a world map that shows
1. Tectonic Plate Data
2. Earthquake Data by magnitude & location
3. Major Earthquake Data (>4.5 magnitude)
The map features four different views in order to produce different visual effects.
