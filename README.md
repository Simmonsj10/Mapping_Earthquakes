# Mapping_Earthquakes
Author: Jerome Simmons

## Background
The purpose of this project is to show the difference beteen earthquakes over the last seven days. We use Javascript and D3.js libraries to analyze GeoJSON earthquake data (magnitude & coordinates) from the USGS website. We will use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
